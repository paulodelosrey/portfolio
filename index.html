          I'm passionate about tackling challenges and finding solutions. Looking back on my journey, I've spent several years dedicated to this task. Working in various fields, I've acquired skills that are transferable to the technology sector, such as time management, effective communication, and decision-making. Two years ago, I made the decision to leave my comfort zone and prepare myself to enter an industry as dynamic as technology. I began my journey with Web Development. Currently, I focus on developing websites using React and Tailwind, providing personalized tutorials in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have completed a backend bootcamp with Java and Spring Boot in the Oracle Next Education program. Throughout this process, I've learned the importance of effectively managing time and how technology can be a great ally in problem-solving. Moreover, teaching others not only reinforces my own learning but also makes me an expert and fosters team building for future challenges. During my leisure time, I enjoy activities such as listening to music, reading online articles, watching movies based on real events, and playing soccer. I invite you to fully explore my work and educational experience on the website, where you can also learn about some of my projects.

          My first job was as a guide at the zoo in my city, when I had not yet finished high school. After graduating, I sold motor care products at a car dealership. From there, I moved on to providing remote support for the generation of social security payment receipts in Colombia. Then I worked as a commercial and technological media advisor at an academic advisory company. Later, I owned a restaurant. During the pandemic, I worked as a delivery driver. After the pandemic, I worked as an operator of a machine called a "calandra" at a textile sublimation company. In that company, with 8 to 10 employees, I was promoted until I became the general manager. Then, together with my wife, we ran her own business, she as a commercial leader with more than 150 saleswomen, and me as her assistant. In total, I have approximately 8 years of work experience. Currently, I work as a freelance developer and provide personalized web development classes. As you can see, I'm not afraid of new challenges. I invite you to take a closer look at my most relevant experiences in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-dasaKtCWOa6HhJy3dk7yxAo-zmMDQrgbe7Lmostqfg/edit">my CV</a>.
