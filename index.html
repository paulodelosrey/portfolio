          I'm passionate about tackling challenges and finding solutions.
          Looking back on my journey, I've spent several years dedicated to this
          task. Working in various fields, I've acquired skills that are
          transferable to the technology sector, such as time management,
          effective communication, and decision-making. Two years ago, I made
          the decision to leave my comfort zone and prepare myself to enter an
          industry as dynamic as technology. I began my journey with Web
          Development. Currently, I focus on developing websites using React and
          Tailwind, providing personalized tutorials in HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, and I'm enrolled in a backend bootcamp with Java in the
          Oracle Next One program. Throughout this process, I've learned the
          importance of effectively managing time and how technology can be a
          great ally in problem-solving. Moreover, teaching others not only
          reinforces my own learning but also makes me an expert and fosters
          team building for future challenges. During my leisure time, I enjoy
          activities such as listening to music, reading online articles,
          watching movies based on real events, and playing soccer. I invite you
          to fully explore my work and educational experience on the website,
          where you can also learn about some of my projects.

        <p>
          My first job was as a guide at the zoo in my city, when I had not yet
          finished high school. After graduating, I sold motor care products at
          a car dealership. From there, I moved on to providing remote support
          for the generation of social security payment receipts in Colombia.
          Then I worked as a commercial and technological media advisor at an
          academic advisory company. Later, I owned a restaurant. During the
          pandemic, I worked as a delivery driver. After the pandemic, I worked
          as an operator of a machine called a "calandra" at a textile
          sublimation company. In that company, with 8 to 10 employees, I was
          promoted until I became the general manager. Then, together with my
          wife, we ran her own business, she as a commercial leader with more
          than 150 saleswomen, and me as her assistant. In total, I have
          approximately 8 years of work experience. As you can see, I'm not
          afraid of new challenges. I invite you to take a closer look at my
